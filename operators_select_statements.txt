####Operators in Select Statements

1. Write out a generic SELECT statement.

	ANSWER: SELECT album
		FROM artists
		WHERE album LIKE '%Yahndi%';

2. Create a fun way to remember the order of operations in a SELECT statement, such as a mnemonic.

3. Given this dogs table, write queries to select the following pieces of data:

>Intake teams typically guess the breed of shelter dogs, so the breed column may have multiple words (for example, "Labrador Collie mix").

	CREATE TABLE dogs (
  "id"          INTEGER, 
  "name"        VARCHAR(25),
  "gender"      VARCHAR(1),
  "age"         INTEGER,
  "weight"      INTEGER,
  "breed"       TEXT,
  "intake_date" DATE,
  "in_foster"   DATE
);

INSERT INTO dogs
  ("id",  "name",      "gender", "age", "weight", "breed",              "intake_date", "in_foster")
VALUES
  (10001, 'Boujee',    'F',       3,     36,      'labrador poodle',    '2017-06-22',   null),

6. List each comparison operator and explain when you would use it. Include a real world example for each.

	ANSWER: a) < -- less than = comparing two values, returning true if value to left of operator is less than value on right. check to see if age is less than 21, not old enough to buy 				alcohol 
		b) > -- greater than = compares to values, returning true if value left of operator is greater than value on right. check to see if age greater than 18, you are legally an adult 
		c) <= -- less than or equal to = Compares to values, returns true if value right of operator is less than or equivalent to value on right.  If you are less than or equal 2 years 			 old you can fly free
		d) >= -- greater than or equal to = compares 2 values, returns true if value left of operator is greater than or equivalent to value on right.  if you are greater than or equal to       		         16 yrs old you can receive drivers license
		e) = -- equal to = compares 2 values and returning true if values are equivalent.  When checking DNA at a crime scene to that of a murder suspect
		f) != , <> -- returning true if values are not equal.  Releasing a suspect when DNA does not match that of the perpetrator 
		g) LIKE -- used when comparing stings, and we only have a partial parameter to compare.  If we only remember part of a song title and need exact name
