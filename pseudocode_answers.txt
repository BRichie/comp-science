##Short Answer

1)Why do programmers use pseudocode?

ANSWER- Programmers use pseudocode in the planning stages to better understand the general structure and algorithms of the desired program before the actual code is written. 

2)If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

ANSWER- Nothing, it is intended for human comprehension and will not translate to functional code for the computer. 

##Programming Assignment

Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:


1) Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
	
	FUNCTION greaterNumber (first number, second number)
		IF first number is greater than second number
			PRINT first number
		ELSE 
			PRINT second number
		END IF
	END FUNCTION
		

2) Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

	FUNCTION countTo100
	SET control value to zero
		WHILE control value is less than one hundred
			INCREMENT control value by one
			PRINT control value
		END WHILE
	END FUNCTION
		


3) Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
	


	FUNCTION phonebookSearch(first name, last name) 
	FOR each object in the phonebook
		IF object is equal to first name and last name
			RETURN object
		END IF
	END FOR	
	END FUNCTION
			 


4) Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

	var person = [
		{firstName: '', lastName: ''}
		]; 



	function phonebookSearch(person){
		for (var i = 0; i < person.length; i++){
			if (person[i] == person.firstName && person.lastName){
			return "Success, we found a match";
			} else {
			  return "No records match your search";
			  }

			}
		};
