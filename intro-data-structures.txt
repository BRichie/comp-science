####INTRO TO DATA STRUCTURES

1. 	a) Use an array input: ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"]


	var peopleWaiting = [
	  	"Vivian", 
		"Ava", 
		"Josh", 
		"Patrick",
		"Mike"
	    ];
	
	b) Insert a new person, "Mary" at the end of the line. In other words, you should 	insert Mary after Mike.
		
		ANSWER: peopleWaiting.push("Mary");

	c)  Find a person in line named "Josh." This function should return the position 	of 2 in the array, (recall that arrays are 0-based).

		ANSWER: peopleWaiting.indexOf("Josh"); 

	d) Find a person in line named "Emily." What should your function return if it 		does not find the item in the array?

		ANSWER: peopleWaiting.indexOf("Emily");
			--Return value of -1 if search value does not occur

	e)  What if Ava wants to allow a friend, "Melissa", to cut in line in front of  	her? How would you code this so Melissa appears before Ava?

		ANSWER: peopleWaiting.splice(1, 0, "Melissa");

	f)  If Patrick wants to leave the line, how would you delete him from the array?

		ANSWER: peopleWaiting.splice(4, 1);

2. Provide another real-world example that you can model using a data structure.

		ANSWER: The hotel industry by adding or reducing the rooms that are 				available on any given day. 

3.  How would your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

		ANSWER:  Developers would be able to access and manipulate the data 				structure by determining the specific value of the elements 				contained in the database.
